class TestMinimumFlips:
    """
    Given 3 positives numbers a, b and c. Return the minimum flips required in some bits of a and b to make ( a OR b == c ). (bitwise OR operation).
    Flip operation consists of change any single bit 1 to 0 or change the bit 0 to 1 in their binary representation.
    Example 1:
    Input: a = 2, b = 6, c = 5
    Output: 3
    Explanation: After flips a = 1 , b = 4 , c = 5 such that (a OR b == c)
    Example 2:
    Input: a = 4, b = 2, c = 7
    Output: 1
    Example 3:
    Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
    Output: 0
    Constraints:
    1 <= a <= 10^9
    1 <= b <= 10^9
    1 <= c <= 10^9
